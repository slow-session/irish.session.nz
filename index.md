We put this site together for people playing Irish Traditional Music in New Zealand. There's not that many of us so when we get together it's nice to have some tunes in common.

## Sessions in Wellington

Two sessions happen in Wellington on Tuesday nights starting at 7:30 pm at the <a href="/dragon/">Welsh Dragon Bar</a>, 10/12 Cambridge Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand. Players of traditional Irish music are welcome.

The evening is split into two parts:

  * For those who want to play at a relaxed pace
  * If you're new to playing at our session, see our <a href="/intro-to-slowsession">Intro</a> page
