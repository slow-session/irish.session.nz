The website is built and maintained by a couple of people:

 * Ted Cizadlo
 * Andy Linton

We both live in Wellington, New Zealand and we're both enthusiastic session players. We built the site to help us and other folks at our local session in our tune learning. Other people around the world have found it useful too.

Go raibh m√≠le maith agat to all the players of the tune clips who've given us permission to use their recordings. We really appreciate your help.

And a big thanks to Jeremy Keith who runs [The Session](https://thesession.org/) for many of the ABC files used on our site.

## Technical Stuff

The code for the website is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/slow-session/irish.session.nz) - if you can use it please help yourself!

There's also a set of WordPress plugins that you can use to slowdown and loop tunes if you're running your website that way - see
