  * For those who want to play at a relaxed pace
  * If you're new to playing at our session, see our <a href="/intro-to-slowsession">Intro</a> page
* <a href="/regularsession/">Regular Session - {{ site.session_time }}</a>
  * For more experienced players who are familiar with playing this music at a high standard
